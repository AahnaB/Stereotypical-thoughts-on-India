      India. 
India is an amazing country filled with various cultures and has multiple heritages. It's also the seventh largest country by area, it even has several different foods in every state (Province) example: Gujarats dhokla or Rajasthans dal bati, but people always think of India as having only poverty and filthy lands. Madiha says ”Whenever I make friends and I’m in a conversation, my background comes up in all of them. 

I say “Oh, I’m from India!” And people usually bring up all the difficulty and hardship in life there is, they talk about India as if it’s a very dirty place and there are not any good schools.” she also says ”They just assume I came here because of the good schools, most people also assume we all have super-minds and are very smart.

 Yes, that is a compliment to most people, but many kids in school nowadays call smart kids "nerds”, or a “know-it-all” and those are both rude words to call someone. If you would have kids calling you a nerd, it would be hard to socialise and make friends. As per Aahna she says “Most news websites from other countries than India show as if India is very poor, even multiple blogs display the same things. I have read an article that said that “tourists go to more of the poverty affected areas of India because it is like a “zoo” for them” I figured out that less people visit beautiful areas like the india gate and Taj Mahal these are only a few examples there are several other heritage related buildings in every states (province) in India that people should visit but most don't.” Even Madiha was shocked when I shared this information with her. Aahna also says ”I’ve heard people think and say that police officers from India support the wrong people and don’t help the innocent. The thing is, the majority of police officers are nice and have helped many people and still continue on to.” Some other things Madiha has found out is “Many people I’ve met, (including adults), have said India has not many job opportunities. But India has many jobs, for example, Medical professionals get paid INR 11 59 833 (18, 896 CAD (lakhs per month)), another example is a data scientist, who gets a pay of INR 11 00 000 (17, 923 CAD).”
Something else that Madiha mentioned when we made this project is “Some people when I was younger said India’s flag looks terrible, and some people say that it’s “trash.” “
We researched and found out that behind the flag of India there are meanings. India’s flag has 3 colours, orange, white, and green. Orange means saffron, which means strength and courage. Green means progress and growth. White means peace and truth. The blue wheel in the centre of the flag is called “Ashok Chakra”, which means constant movement and progress.

We respectfully request not to mention all of these stereotypical thoughts about any country, not just ours. Thank you for reading, we hope this has made an impact on your view about India.
